Plant Palette – Website Project
Overview

This project is a three-page website for a vegan restaurant called Plant Palette.
The site includes a Home page, a Menu page, and an Our Team page.
I built the website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap and matched it with the design I created in Figma.

My Process

First, I looked at my Figma design and planned how each page should look in code.
I used Bootstrap to set up the layout and make the site responsive.
Then I added my own CSS to style the colors, spacing, images, and animations so the site looked like the design.

I also tried to keep the code clean by using semantic HTML (like header, main, and section) and adding alt text to images.

Challenges I Faced

Making it mobile friendly:
Some sections didn’t look good on smaller screens. I fixed this using Bootstrap columns and CSS.

Navbar not changing on phone:
The navbar wasn’t collapsing. I replaced it with Bootstrap’s mobile menu (hamburger icon).

Validator errors:
I had warnings about missing alt text and headings. I fixed everything by adding proper descriptions and hidden headings.

Image sizes:
Some images were stretching. I used object-fit: cover to keep them looking good.
